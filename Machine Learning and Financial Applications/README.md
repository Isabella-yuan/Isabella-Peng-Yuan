Step 1 Performed feature engineering using binning strategy, one-hot encoding, min-max feature scaling, and feature selection;  
Step 2  Conducted preliminary model selection based on F2 scores for 7 models of base classifiers and ensemble methods of bagging and boosting;  
Step 3  Utilized GridSearchCV of shuffled StratifiedKFold to do hyperparameter tuning for selected models.
